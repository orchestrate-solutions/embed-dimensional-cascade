# Dimensional Cascade: Multi-Resolution Semantic Search

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a novel "Dimensional Cascade" architecture for efficient semantic search. The approach uses a series of progressively reduced-dimension models derived from the same foundation, enabling ultra-fast initial retrieval with increasingly precise refinement. This creates a configurable precision/performance trade-off while maintaining semantic coherence across all resolution levels.

## Core Concept

Dimensional Cascade employs a series of embedding models with diminishing vector dimensions, each preserving the most significant semantic features from higher-dimensional spaces. Like reducing decimal precision (0.91234567 → 0.9123 → 0.91), each step retains core meaning while reducing computational complexity.

## Architecture Overview

### Model Hierarchy

```
│
├── Primary Model (1024d)
│   └── Level 1 Reduction (512d)
│       └── Level 2 Reduction (256d)
│           └── Level 3 Reduction (128d)
│               └── Level 4 Reduction (64d)
│                   └── Level 5 Reduction (32d)
│                       └── Level 6 Reduction (16d)

```

### Search Flow

1. **Initial Broad Search** (16d/32d) - Extremely fast initial filtering
2. **Progressive Refinement** - Move up dimensional levels for candidate sets
3. **Final Precision** - Apply highest dimensions only to the most promising candidates

### Example Query Flow

```
Query → Embed → Search 16d space (10,000 candidates)
                 → Refine with 64d (1,000 candidates)
                   → Refine with 256d (100 candidates)
                     → Final ranking with 1024d
```

## Training Approaches

We propose three methodologies for creating the dimensional cascade:

### Approach 1: Dimension Truncation with Fine-Tuning

1. Train full 1024d embedding model on complete dataset
2. Create truncated versions (512d, 256d, etc.) by removing dimensions
3. Fine-tune each truncated model to optimize performance at that dimension level
4. Ensure alignment between different dimensional representations

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- Preserves most important dimensions
- Computationally efficient

**Challenges:**
- Naive truncation may not preserve optimal information
- May require additional alignment training

### Approach 2: Distillation Cascade

1. Train primary 1024d teacher model to convergence
2. Train 512d student model to mimic 1024d model's similarity judgments
3. Use 512d model as teacher for 256d model
4. Continue distillation down the cascade

**Advantages:**
- Each model optimized specifically for its dimension count
- Potentially better performance than simple truncation
- Knowledge transferred efficiently down the cascade

**Challenges:**
- More complex training pipeline
- Requires careful distillation objective design
- May drift from original semantics at lower levels

### Approach 3: Autoencoder Dimensional Reduction

1. Train primary 1024d embedding model
2. Create autoencoders for each dimension level (512d, 256d, etc.)
3. Train each to reconstruct the higher-dimensional representation
4. Use encoder portions as the dimensional reduction models

**Advantages:**
- Mathematically optimal information preservation
- Explicit optimization for reconstruction
- Well-established theoretical foundation

**Challenges:**
- Complex training process
- Computationally intensive
- May require larger models at each level

### Query Routing Logic

```python
def search_with_cascade(query, top_k=100):
    # Embed query at all dimension levels
    query_embeddings = embed_at_all_levels(query)
    
    # Start with broadest search
    candidates = search_level(query_embeddings[16], level=16, limit=10000)
    
    # Progressive refinement
    candidates = refine_with_level(candidates, query_embeddings[64], level=64, limit=1000)
    candidates = refine_with_level(candidates, query_embeddings[256], level=256, limit=100)
    
    # Final precision ranking
    final_results = rank_with_full_precision(candidates, query_embeddings[1024])
    
    return final_results[:top_k]
```
