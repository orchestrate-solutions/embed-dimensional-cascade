# Dimensional Cascade: Key Concepts

This document summarizes the core concepts behind the dimensional cascade approach for efficient and semantically meaningful vector search.

## Vector Truncation and Normalization

### What Happens During Truncation
1. We extract the first N elements of a higher-dimensional vector
   ```
   From [0.123, 0.234, 0.259, 0.892] → [0.123, 0.234]
   ```
2. We normalize the truncated vector to ensure it has unit length
   ```
   From [0.123, 0.234] → [0.46527865, 0.88516426]
   ```

### Why Normalization Is Critical

Normalization preserves the directional information (the angle between vectors) while standardizing vector lengths:

1. **Preserves Semantic Direction**
   - When we normalize vectors, we maintain their directional information, which is what matters for semantic similarity
   - Although the numerical values change drastically, vectors that pointed in similar directions in high dimensions continue to point in similar directions in lower dimensions

2. **Enables Consistent Similarity Calculations**
   - For semantic search, cosine similarity is the standard metric (measures angular difference)
   - Normalization ensures all vectors have unit length, making cosine similarity calculations consistent

3. **Creates Natural Taxonomic Organization**
   - Lower dimensions capture broader semantic concepts (more general)
   - Higher dimensions add specificity and nuance (more specific)
   - This forms a natural hierarchy from generic to specific

### The Mathematics of Normalization

#### L2 Normalization Formula

For a vector v = [v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ], L2 normalization produces a unit vector in the same direction:

v̂ = v / ||v||₂

Where ||v||₂ is the L2 norm (Euclidean length) of the vector:

||v||₂ = √(v₁² + v₂² + ... + vₙ²)

#### Example Calculation

For the vector [0.123, 0.234]:

1. Calculate the L2 norm:
   ||v||₂ = √(0.123² + 0.234²) = √(0.015129 + 0.054756) = √0.069885 = 0.264358

2. Divide each component by the norm:
   v̂ = [0.123/0.264358, 0.234/0.264358] = [0.46527865, 0.88516426]

#### Geometric Interpretation

Normalization can be understood geometrically as:
- Projecting the vector onto the unit hypersphere
- Preserving only the directional component of the vector, discarding magnitude
- Converting all vectors to lie on the surface of a unit hypersphere, where the angular distance between points corresponds to semantic similarity

#### Cosine Similarity After Normalization

For two normalized vectors û and v̂:
- Their dot product û·v̂ directly gives the cosine of the angle between them
- Cosine similarity = û·v̂ = cos(θ)
- Range: [-1, 1] where 1 means identical direction, 0 means orthogonal, -1 means opposite directions
- With normalized vectors, cosine similarity computation simplifies to a dot product

#### Impact on Distance Metrics

After normalization:
1. **Euclidean distance** between two normalized vectors u and v is directly related to cosine similarity:
   ||u - v||₂² = 2(1 - cos(θ))

2. **Inner product** (dot product) becomes equivalent to cosine similarity:
   u·v = cos(θ)

This relationship allows vector databases like FAISS to use efficient inner product operations instead of more expensive cosine similarity calculations.

#### Real-World Analogies and Examples

To make these mathematical concepts more intuitive:

1. **Viewing a Landscape from Different Distances**
   - High-dimensional vector: Standing close to a detailed landscape, seeing every tree, rock, flower
   - Lower-dimensional vector: Stepping back, losing fine details but keeping the overall composition
   - Normalization: Ensures you're focusing on "what" you're seeing, not how bright or large it is

2. **How Our Brains Recognize Concepts**
   - We can recognize a "dog" whether it's a tiny chihuahua or a giant mastiff
   - We ignore the "magnitude" (size) and focus on the "direction" (dog-like features)
   - Normalization does the same - focusing on pattern/direction, not scale

3. **Semantic Search Examples**
   - High-dimension (768D): "red sports car with leather interior"
   - Mid-dimension (128D): "car" or "automobile" 
   - Low-dimension (32D): "vehicle" or "transportation"
   - Lowest dimensions: "physical object"

4. **Map Zoom Levels**
   - High-dimensions: Street-level view with building details
   - Lower-dimensions: City-level view showing neighborhoods
   - Lowest-dimensions: Country-level view showing only major regions
   - In each case, you maintain the "location" (direction) but with different levels of detail

The math (dividing by the norm) essentially tells us to focus on which direction a vector points (its meaning), not how "intense" or "large" it is - similar to how we recognize concepts regardless of their size or intensity.

## Dimensional Cascade Approach

The dimensional cascade approach leverages these properties to create an efficient search system:

1. **Progressive Refinement**
   - Start with low-dimensional vectors to quickly identify broad semantic matches
   - Progressively move to higher dimensions, but only search within promising candidates
   - This dramatically reduces the search space at each step

2. **Natural Taxonomy**
   - Lower dimensions (~32D) = broader conceptual categories
   - Mid dimensions (~128D) = more specific categories
   - High dimensions (~512D+) = highly specific semantic details

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Store vectors at multiple dimensions
   - For queries, generate corresponding vectors at each dimension level
   - Search from lowest to highest dimension, filtering candidates at each step

## Search Operations

### Broadening Searches
Two approaches to finding "more general" results:

1. **Increasing top-k**
   - Returns more results from the same dimensional space
   - Still prioritizes closest matches in that specific dimension

2. **Searching in Lower Dimensions**
   - More powerful for finding conceptually related items
   - Naturally groups semantically related concepts together
   - Transforms the search to be inherently more general
   - Example:
     - 768D: "red sports car with leather interior"
     - 64D: might represent just "vehicle"
     - 16D: might represent "physical object"

### Vector Database Implementation

Dimensional cascade can be implemented as "dimension views" in vector databases:

1. **Store the full-dimension vectors as base data**
2. **Create dimension views through preprocessing**:
   - When adding vectors to the database, automatically create truncated+normalized versions
   - Store these as additional "views" of the same vector at different dimensions
   - Create indices for each dimension view for efficient searching

3. **Implementation approaches**:
   - **Pre-compute approach**: Generate all dimension views when vectors are first inserted
   - **On-demand approach**: Generate dimension views as needed and cache them
   - **Hybrid approach**: Pre-compute common dimensions, generate others on demand

## Important Constraints

1. **Dimension Matching Required**:
   - You can only directly compare vectors of the same dimension
   - A 2D vector can't be meaningfully compared to a 1024D vector
   - Both database and query vectors must be truncated to the same dimensions

2. **Consistent Normalization**:
   - All vectors within a dimension must be normalized the same way
   - Typically using L2 normalization (unit vectors)

## Benefits of the Approach

1. **Efficiency**: Dramatically reduces search space at higher dimensions
2. **Semantically Meaningful**: Creates a natural taxonomy from general to specific
3. **Flexibility**: Allows for both broad and specific searches
4. **Scalability**: Scales well to large vector databases
